# Reconciliation in Chaos : Tracing word counts and sentiments in Palace of the End

## general

Contained here are three scripts for parsing and collecting data on Judith Thompson's Palace of the End. This data was used for the paper Reconciliation in Chaos, published in April 2019 by The Channel, the McGill University undergraduate English journal. 

All scripts are written in R. paragraphs_script.r compiles data based on the paragraph breaks in the text and raw_script.r compiles data based on sets of words defined by the used. sentiment_comparison.r compares the results from the data collection and visualizations.r presents the results in human-readable format.
